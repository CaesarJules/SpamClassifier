87603,"What an aggrevating piece of garbage!  Got this for my son when he started running because it was less than a Garmin (should have gone on with a good GPS watch). Impossible to calibrate - ruined lots of runs in our attempts to do so. Thought the other negative reviews were whiners and we'd figure it out. This is simply, truly, a poorly performing product.

47035,"So far the product itself seems okay.  However, there is some buzzing when we run it through the fm stero.  My main issue with this product is that they advertise that is has a built in tv-tuner, and this was the deciding factor in our purchase.  If it does indeed have the tuner as described (there is nothing that on the box or in the accompanying manual, and I could not find anything that would indicate it as a feature on the remote or the system panel) I could not figure out how to operate it.  When I called the seller, I was told that it had an analog tuner and that I would not be able to pick up stations any longer on it since there has been a switch to hd broadcasting.  If this is so, then why advertise that feature or more to the point why not describe it as an analog tv tuner.",verified,Real

3296,"Walmart used to sell cheapy $10ish adapters like this that barely worked, and this one blows them out of the water. Audio is completely clear, except for the minor distortion inherent to receiving signals via antenna instead of from directly in the car. You do have to bump up the audio on your device a bit and on your stereo, as it comes in quieter than you might expect, but I don't hear any distortions from that either..<br /><br />Easy and simple to operate, no extra frills or anything. Just pick a station and play. It does NOT have a scanner to find an open station automatically, but that's not a huge deal, just a bit more initial effort on your part.<br /><br />The charger itself has a slim form factor, so I could actually pull out my cupholder and use it properly instead of having my old charger block it.<br /><br />The cable has plenty of length for you to snake it around the dash and mount it somehow if you wish, otherwise maybe consider putting a tie around it to keep it small.<br /><br />Ultimately, if you're looking for a decent car charger and FM transmitter, this is the one to get!",verified,Real
