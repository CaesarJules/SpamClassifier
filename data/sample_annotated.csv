"Anyone who is old enough to remember when a computer didn't mean something electronic, might be able to relate to a Jeppesen Flight Computer. It's like a slide rule that once solved the mysteries of tangents, signs and cosigns in trigonometry. The Jeppesen is the same thing and more and it's round.<br /><br />I got my first one when I was taking pilot training in my senior year of college. It could calculate true air speed and ground speed, distance, fuel usage, time to destination, and several other calculations you might not use but it was there if you needed it that one time. Soon after I kept it in my glove compartment for long car trips, and as long as I maintained my speed and knew that Birmingham, AL was 230 miles away, I could predict to the minute my time of arrival at the same place.<br /><br />If you are learning to fly for the first time by Piper Cub or Cherokee, and your airfoil doesn't have an inertial navigation system, this is a must for the student pilot.<br /><br />It's still a novel experience to know there is a computer that doesn't depend on a charge and gives you accurate information to distance, time, amount of fuel, etc, etc.<br /><br />This is what seems to be a marvel of genius.",not_verified,Spam

"I have had this product for at least a year and it does not last! The knobs need to be re-calibrated after a while( I don't even know how they became offset), but there are no options for that in the software. The plastic is very cheap and the jog wheels are TOO sensitive. The slightest touch could set them off. The scratching sounds artificial and when you try to put the BPM up via controller's jog wheels, the BPM will revert to whatever you had it. The software is becoming quite glitchy now and unreliable. The only reason this is getting a two instead of a one is because you can use it as a midi interface.<br /><br />Improvements needed:<br />Headphone jack<br />Loop buttons on the controller for the desired beat lengths.<br />The ability to recalibrate knobs.<br />Better scratching and non-reverting BPM changes.<br /><br />Other than that, it is great to get your feet wet in DJ'ing if you want to get into it, just don't try to DJ at a club with this thing, it's embarrassingly small and does not look the slightest bit legitimate.",verified,Real

"I just bought this for my kids so they could watch all of their movies without having to change DVDs. For this the player works great. The only drawback is that the player doesn't understand ISO files, so I can't just copy the entire DVD to the drive and have it play with all of the menus, etc. However, the device does understand VOB file (which is the file format that DVDs use), and I was able to use a program called DVD2one to merge the DVD into a single file for each DVD and it plays perfectly without any loss of quality. (Although only the movie plays, bonus features aren't available.)    Otherwise, the box performs perfectly. I was able to play most of the Divx, Mpeg, mp4, and other movies without any problems. Unfortuantely, MKV and FLV files aren't supported. Hopefully this will be fixed in a firmware update sometime in the future.     The Music feature is also useful for letting my sons (ages 5 and 8) play their audiobooks. (Although I wish they had included a screen saver to prevent video burn-in)    The ability to plug in another usb hard drive, flash drive, or SD card is also very nice, and you can even copy and delete files from one drive to another directly from the menus using the remote.    I will probably be buying at least one more of these for myself, and will be recommending these to both my mother and my in-laws. The menus are simple enough that the technology-challenged should be able to understand them fairly well.",verified,Real

"This case is not designed for the ipad. The ipad fits with generous room, it's a very sloppy fit, with over an inch of clearance on 2 sides when slid to an inner corner. The case emits a strong odor, like inside a plastics factory. It appears to be solidly built. If you are looking for a good fitting ipad case I would not recommend this one. It appears to be sold as an ipad accessory because one will slip into the case, otherwise it does not appear to be designed for the ipad at all. One could easily fit two or more ipads or most netbooks in this zipper case. This case/sleeve should not be marketed as an ipad case because it is not.",not_verified,Real

"Bought two. One for my wife and one for me. Love the convenience of when they work but too often they fly out of the lighter or slam down on our consoles. They fall out when driving or just slams down in the direction of a turn of the vehicle.     My recommendation is for the engineers or manufacturers to add some type of base (tripod, etc) to anchor or support it and help balance it while it is inserted in the car lighter.

"As new RV'ers we thought having a GPS that tracked height, road work, etc. would be a great addition. And for certain things, it is. But out of the first 10 RV parks we booked, one was not in the data base (not a small one, either). For another the GPs warned us that we would be on a dirt road, which was correct. But instead of directing us to the exit the RV park was on (as listed in Woodalls), it wanted us to take the exit before that one. The problem was that exit put us on a dirt road coming in from the back of the park for about a mile. The exit the park was actually at (as on their web site and Woodalls) had a dirt road for about 100 yards. Luckily, our iPad app and Mapquest with satellite view showed us the correct way.     Also, this GPS could not find the street (as listed on that RV parks website and in Woodalls) for one of the parks.     I do like the feature it has of being able to show the nearby/up coming truck fuel stops, that is a great help.     I really wanted to like this GPS but simply cannot recommend this unit. The navigation is not intuitive but can be learned. But it is cumbersome. Entering an address seems more aimed at truckers that have a specific business address. It is frustrating when it is an access road address, for instance.     Mapquest figured all this stuff out long ago. There are free RV park apps for the iPhone and iPad that give you the same info or close to the same info. And so far the RV parks seem to be all there (that is with our extremely limited experience. But having one out of ten not found doesn't give me a warm and fuzzy feeling about the database for this Rand Mcnally GPS).     If I could return the unit I would, but I have struggled with it for more than the 30 day limit.  Look for it cheap on eBay.    For a few more bucks and a lot more function, buy an iPad.",not_verified,Real

"I love this device.  Had one since early 2009 from an amazon seller.  This is my second and last one, though.  Touch technology will simply pass it by.  In the meantime...  Pros:  Great radio - can connect it anywhere.  Record programs easily.  Syncs well with my windows 7 pc.  Sansa Software converts my videos and pictures and puts them where I want them (either in the 4gb internal drive or the 8gb microSD card).  I exercise with this device and travel with it.  I record my business meetings (works efficiently) Sturdy (especially with the plastic case cover) and the lightweight, clean and simple design is aesthetically pleasing.  Simple to use.  I use windows media player to synch my playlists.  Great battery.  And don't I look happy when I run...  BTW - this came with w/ 4GB MicroSDHC Card (8GB Total) & BlueProton USB 2.0 Reader.  This was also fun and useful (allowing me to carry music in my wallet to a birthday party and downloaded to an ipod via a PC).  We danced for hours.  Nice touch with the sansa.

"Got my Verizon iPhone a few weeks ago, well aware of the breakage issues when gravity gets a hold of it (which it always will). Wanted to make sure that the phone I just got can survive for the life of my contract extension, didnt really want to encase the whole thing in a secondary case (weight and aesthetics), but wanted something more substantial than the stock Apple bumper. For $5 less than Apple's OEM case, went with the Impactband, and I couldn't be happier (well I'd be happier if the phone was sturdier, but thats neither here nor there). Anyway, I feel much more confident that this case will protect my phone for a long time, and that confidence means that I am more comfortable using and enjoying my iPhone, and less worried about coddling it. As for the complaints about using headphones with this case, I have only run into that issue with cords that have 90 degree plugs, not with my headphones with straight plugs (skullcandy specifically). According to their website, they tweaked the design in December 2010, so maybe the newer one has addressed this issue. If you really have an issue, but enjoy protecting your $300+ dollar phone, go to radioshack and get a 99c headphone adapter, should do the trick. In regards to the typing in portrait mode, I have pretty big thumbs, and I still havent noticed it being a very common issue (hitting the sides and missing a button that is). Otherwise, I like the look of the case, just makes the phone look a little tougher (but you definitely lose the thinness of the phone because the case is almost twice as thick) but I would rather have an \\""ugly\\"" working phone than a sleek cracked screen anyday. It's definitely a personal preference, but I really enjoy having this case protecting my investment.",not_verified,Real

"I have absolutely loved this product!! Before I always had to make sure to charge my iPhone or iPad on my drive to and back from work to make sure it would last all day (especially on a day when I used them both a lot). Now when I'm at work and I see my phone is about half way I just plug it in and I don't have to worry about it dying on me later. I do not have access to a wall outlet at work so this has definitely been the perfect answer for that. It really charges my iPhone quite fast. I was able too leave it at work for a week and never have to worry about my phone dying and the charge lasted to whole time on the battery. I never worry about how long the batter takes to charge as I just plug it in before going to bed and it's read to go by morning. It works just as promised being able to charge my phone 350%. When using it to charge both an iPhone and iPad it definitely drains the battery quicker so I don't use it much for my iPad as the iPad holds a charge longer than my phone.

"Alright, I will write the good things and bad things about this product from the seller YB Planet.    ****Good Things****  1) The seller made sure that the product arrived earlier than the estimated time frame. I placed the order on Tuesday and got the product by Friday of that same week! Awesome!  2) The product had a lower price than most competitors which somewhat relieved my wallet.    ****Bad Things****  1) The screw drivers that came with the product WERE NOT PH00. You need the screwdrivers PH00 in order to remove the tiny screws inside the iPod touch. I would recommend you buy the screwdrivers PH00 from Wal*Mart. I bought a Screwdrivers Set (60 Piece Set) which included the PH00 screwdriver from Wal*Mart for only $9.99!  2) The double sided tape that came with this product was EXTREMELY difficult to apply due to me not being able to take off the covering paper. This double sided tape is NOT beginner-friendly. I had to throw it away and buy the Elmer's Instant Krazy Glue from my local flea market for only $1.00 which worked perfectly!!!  3) Most of the plastic tools were useless to me since I am a beginner and did not know how to use them. The tips of these plastic tools also broke easily when I tried to pry off the broken screen for the first time!  4) The replacement screen did not FIT perfectly on to my iPod Touch 4G. It appears to be around 1 millimeter TOO short in LENGTH. Also, since this is a cheap screen, there are white spots now on this new screen that I bought from trying to apply pressure in an effort to fit this new screen just like the original screen used to fit.    So, I talk a lot, but here is my final advice. LOL    If you are looking for a quick cheap fix, have your own tools or are willing to buy your own, have your own Elmer's Instant Krazy Glue, have a heat gun, and have some knowledge, or confidence, on fixing your iPod Touch 4G's broken screen then this product is JUST FOR YOU! YES! YOU!    PS: If you buy this product, do not apply toomuch pressure around the white/black edges of your new ipod touch screen for you will leave lighter spots around the edges of the LCD screen!

I could start my own radio station with the amount of space I still had left. I had no trouble with the download when working with the Windows Media Player. Seemed to work very well with it.<br /><br />The only downside (as the others have mentioned) is the lack of shuffle ability. Other than that its perfect.",verified,Spam
It wasnt what I thot and I cant use it. Need to return it. Its just the outside of a key and is useless.,verified,Real
"Item came without packaging, but it was self explanatory and works great. Now I have tunes in my old hooptie.",verified,Real
Lost one of my silicone sleves that came with my Shure earphones.  Ordered these and I am back listening again.  They do not seem to accumulate earwax and fit my E2c just right.,verified,Real
I bought this product for my 14 year daughter.<br />For some reason the mini USB adaptor was missing (required to charge the battery) luckily I had another cable from a different product.<br /><br />this is the reason for 3 stars<br />Assi.,verified,Real
"Good unit, excellent maps, I have not seen any map errors yet. I also have the audio problem other reviewers mentioned, but its not a deal breaker. I also have the washout problem on sunny days. I would give this unit 5 stars if the display was brighter. Also, the manual that came with the unit is lame, but all my questions were answered by the seller.  Ipod plug works great, I found using blutooth to play music from my phone was hard to figure out, however receiving calls with blutooth  through the radio worked great.. steering wheel controls all worked like before. I used a different backup camera than came with the radio and it worked great. you will need to Allow yourself some time to get familiar with the unit. Its still better than trying to piece together a radio/gps/backup camera from different sources. Installation In my 2010 F150 Raptor was not too bad with help from a few youtube videos",verified,Spam
